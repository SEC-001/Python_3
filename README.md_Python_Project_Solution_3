import random

# Step 1: Define a function to play the game
def guess_name():
    # List of names
    names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"]

    # Step 2: Pick a random name from the list
    secret_name = random.choice(names)

    # Step 3: Ask the user to guess the name
    guess = input("Guess a name from the list: Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve: ")

    # Step 4: Check if the guess is correct
    if guess == secret_name:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed it right.")
    else:
        print("Sorry, that's not correct. Try again!")

# Step 5: Run the function
guess_name()
